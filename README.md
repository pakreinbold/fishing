## What's our goal as fishermen?
We are interested in whether or not our bait will be successful in attracting fish. Let a type of bait be denoted by $i$ and be described a numeric array ${\bf b}_i$. Suppose our boat can deploy several lines with different bait concurrently. Denote this set of bait by $I$. If we let the set of all available bait be $I_A$, then $i\in I\subset I_A$.

## What is a fish?
Denote a species of fish by $k$ and let all individuals of a given species be identical. A member of a particular species can be described by a numeric array $\phi_k$. The elements of this array can represent abstractly food preference, size, color, etc.
